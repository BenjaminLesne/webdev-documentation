# Introduction

Setup:

- typescript
- eslint
- eslint plugins for all libraries
- Knip
- Playwright
- Docker?

Checklist when installing libraries:
- is there an eslint plugin?

    "eslint": "^8.57.0",
    "eslint-config-prettier": "^9.1.0",
    "eslint-plugin-playwright": "^1.6.2",

# Phases of building a software:

## Idea
From the client or you have one. Basically, a need should be described and a sketch of the solution to it (design, what it will do, etc.)

A definition of the targeted audience should be done.

A list of technologies that will be used for the software and why.
A lot of questions should rise during this phase and answered.

## Prototype/Demo
An MVP feature/product should be identified. This is THE very core feature of the software. A single feature to rule them all.

When identified, make as many prototype of it as needed, no design yet, just a working ugly MVP made with different technologies/architecture to make a proof of concept

Again, show it to the client, feedbacks should come out of it.

## Wireframes
Now that we validated the idea, the technologies, architecture etc.
We design with figma the software.

Figma "Prototype" will be create out of it and used to make a video to show how could look like the application to the client.

Feedback time again.

## Start development
Design are agreed with the clients. Time to code. An architecture should have been figured out from the previous staged questions/answers/feedbacks.
