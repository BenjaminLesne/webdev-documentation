# How to vibe code

## How to prompt

1. Pick a task that is neither too big or too small

Too small, and you're not moving fast enough
Too big, and you'll blow your context window, even on 3.7 Max.

2. Get your agent to give you 2 implementation plans

Agents will greedily sample the first plan they think of. Get them to give you two different ones.

3. Choose an implementation plan, tell the agent to turn it into a multi-step plan .md file with checkboxes

We'll be using a new chat per stage, so figuring out how much to do in each stage is an art.

4. Pass the whole plan into context, and tell the agent "implement stage 1".

The whole plan gives the agent context about what it's supposed to be doing.

During this bit, check the rest of the implementation plan yourself.

5. Let your feedback loops do the work

Any VSCode 'problem' (i.e. reported as a squiggly line) will get sent to your agent automatically.

Tell your agent RUN THE TESTS BEFORE SHOWING ME THE CODE OR YOU WILL BE FIRED.

6. Iterate on your rules

Rules can help every part of this process - from picking the right amount of work to do per step to telling the agent about interesting scripts in the repo.

7. Pay attention to the code

This is especially true early in a project, where you're establishing the abstractions. Once the agent has some examples to follow, its work gets a lot smarter.

8. Make code easier to delete

The economics of refactoring have changed. It's now cheaper to delete code and re-do it than to refactor it.

This means that highly decoupled systems, where modules are easy to delete, will benefit most from AI.

9. Use Gemini As A Quality Check

Hooking up Gemini, with its massive context window, to check the entire codebase (via a MCP server) can be a good feedback loop.

Can help to spot duplicated code, enforce good usage patterns, etc.
