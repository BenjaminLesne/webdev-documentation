# Introduce Knip to a codebase

## Your first clean up

To avoid gigantic merge requests, start small. You can use each of the following flags at a time which will only remove a certain type of unused code:

- --production
- --export
- --files
- --dependencies

I would start with:

```bash
knip --production --export
```

This will only remove unused exports from your production code. Hopefully this will cut down the amount of unused code and simplified the merge request comprehension from your teammates.
